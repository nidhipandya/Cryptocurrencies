# Cryptocurrencies

### Unsupervised machine learning

The purpose of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system.

Using unsupervised machine learning , we 
1. Prepared the data for PCA
2. Reduced the data dimensions using PCA
3. Clustered Cryptocurrencies using K-means
4. Visualized Cryptocurrencies Results

we used a clustering algorithm to group the cryptocurrencies. and used data visualizations to share our finings with the team.

#### Results:
* Created an elbow curve to find the best value for K, K=4
